# Upsilon-Cryptocurrency-Tracker

My first vanilla JS website that uses the Coin Ranking API to constantly update % change in cryptocurrency prices and provide statistics, as well as sorting data by coin price and
coin name.

The website application is still in testing stages since I am having problems with CORS.
